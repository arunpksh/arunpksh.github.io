The mechanical properties of Mg-Al alloys are greatly influenced by the complex intermetallic phase Mg17Al12, which is the most dominant precipitate found in this alloy system. The interaction of basal edge and 30o dislocations with Mg17Al12 precipitates is studied by molecular dynamics and statics simulations, varying the inter-precipitate spacing (L), and size (D), shape and orientation of the precipitates. The critical resolved shear stress τc to pass an array of precipitates follows the usual ln((1/D + 1/L)−1) proportionality. In all cases but the smallest precipitate, the dislocations pass the obstacles by depositing dislocation segments in the disordered interphase boundary rather than shearing the precipitate or leaving Orowan loops in the matrix around the precipitate. An absorbed dislocation increases the stress necessary for a second dislocation to pass the precipitate also by absorbing dislocation segments into the boundary. Replacing the precipitate with a void of identical size and shape decreases the critical passing stress and work hardening contribution while an artificially impenetrable Mg17Al12 precipitate increases both. These insights will help improve mesoscale models of hardening by incoherent particles.},

   abstract = {The deformation behavior of ⟨110⟩-oriented twinned Au nanowires (NWs) with multiple longitudinal coherent twin boundaries (CTBs) under tension is studied using in−situ experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The twinned NWs show higher yield strength than the single-crystalline NWs with similar diameter. Postmortem observations using electron microscopy and MD simulations show that the presence of CTBs transitions the governing mechanism from twinning-mediated deformation in single-crystalline NWs to strongly localized deformation. MD simulations reveal that the intersection of deposited partial dislocations at the CTB with the free surfaces plays an important role in the transmission of the dislocation, leading to the formation of full dislocations instead of partial dislocations and twinning in the case of single-crystalline NWs. The repeated activation of full dislocation slip leading to localized deformation is furthermore dependent on the relative orientation of surface facets to the activated Burgers vectors. The results of this work enhance the understanding of deformation mechanisms of twinned nano-objects and suggest design strategies for mechanical systems at the nanoscale.},

Accurate and reliable description of the microstructure, particularly in the case of large deformations, requires the usage of remeshing procedures and the mapping of the material state from the distorted mesh onto a new mesh. In this work, we evaluate three different solution mapping schemes, viz. closest point projection (CPP), sequential spherical linear interpolation (SLERP), and weighted spherical averages, all of which are based on the mapping of crystal plasticity variables. The results show that the mapping with CPP is generally acceptable, whilst the sequential SLERP is a more robust method with little additional computing effort.},

   abstract = {The accumulative roll bonding process allows to produce multilayered composites in which substantially dissimilar metals, both in terms of Young's modulus as well as mechanical strength, can be brought together. For the optimization of such laminated metal composites a fundamental understanding of the microstructural interactions and deformation processes at the internal material interfaces is necessary. The influence of a gradient in hardness and Young's modulus in ultrafine-grained laminated metal composites on the monotonic and cyclic mechanical properties is investigated in this paper. Special attention is put on aluminum/steel composites, as a high gradient in hardness and Young's modulus is present at the layer interfaces. The mechanical properties are determined in monotonic and cyclic three-point bending tests. By scanning electron microscopy, the influence of the meso- and microstructure on the fatigue properties is intensively studied. Furthermore, the internal stresses during elastic straining are calculated using finite element simulations. The results are that for the aluminum/steel composites the monotonic and cyclic properties are drastically increased compared to aluminum mono-material sheets, as well as to composites based on two different aluminum alloys, in which only a gradient in hardness at the material interface exists and the gradient in elastic properties is absent. This is related to a pronounced crack deviation at the material interface as well as to an effective load transfer in the composites.},

The focused ion beam (FIB) technique has established itself as an indispensable tool in the material science community, both to analyze samples and to prepare specimens by FIB milling. In combination with digital image correlation (DIC), FIB milling can, furthermore, be used to evaluate intrinsic stresses by monitoring the strain release during milling. The irradiation damage introduced by such milling, however, results in a change in the stress/strain state and elastic properties of the material; changes in the strain state in turn affect the bonding strength, and are hence expected to implicitly influence irradiation damage formation and sputtering. To elucidate this complex interplay between strain, irradiation damage and sputtering, we perform TRIM calculations and molecular dynamics simulations on silicon irradiated by Ga +  ions, with slab and trench-like geometries, whilst simultaneously applying uniaxial tensile and compressive strains up to 4%. In addition we calculate the threshold displacement energy (TDE) and the surface binding energy (SBE) for various strain states. The sputter rate and amount of damage produced in the MD simulations show a clear influence of the strain state. The SBE shows no significant dependence on strain, but is strongly affected by surface reconstructions. The TDE shows a clear strain-dependence, which, however, cannot explain the influence of strain on the extent of the induced irradiation damage or the sputter rate.},

At these reduced grain sizes, grain boundaries (GBs) play a very important role in the deformation of such materials. Large scale atomistic simulations that are often used to illuminate the deformation mechanisms in such materials must accurately account for the topology, structure and network of GBs. In this work, we perform atomistic simulations on nanocrystalline aluminum under tensile loading, using a structure with a relaxed GB network obtained from three-dimensional grain growth simulations, and compare the results to that obtained from structures generated using the Voronoi tessellation method. The results show that the grain growth sample results in consistently higher macroscopic stresses when compared to the Voronoi tessellated microstructures. The latter, additionally, tend to overestimate GB deformation, whilst simultaneously underestimating the deformation due to dislocation slip. More importantly, twinning is observed in multiple grains in the grain growth sample, in contrast to the near absence in Voronoi tessellated microstructures. The results are carefully discussed in terms of sample characteristics, stacking fault energies, and GB structure and network.},

The accumulative roll bonding process is one of the most prominent severe plastic deformation processes for obtaining sheet materials with ultra-fine-grained microstructures and high strength. The properties of such sheets differ significantly from those of conventionally rolled sheets. It is hence desirable to have a simulation framework that can accurately predict the material properties, including the evolving texture and anisotropy during processing. Here, we propose such a framework for multiple pass rolling using explicit finite elements and embedding the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) polycrystal texture model for the material response. To facilitate multiple pass rolling, we propose a novel solution mapping scheme that transfers the material state from the deformed finite element mesh to a new one. Additionally, we implement a two-level parallelization scheme - with decomposition of the FE domain using message passing interface (MPI) and thread based parallelization of the material response using openMP - to ensure reduced simulation times. The predictive capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated by simulating the accumulative roll bonding of aluminum alloy AA5754 sheets. The simulations validate the working of the solution mapping scheme, and clearly show the development of a through thickness gradient of texture and anisotropy in the roll-bonded sheet after two passes.},

   abstract = {Due to the absence of sufficient number of slip systems in hexagonal close packed (hcp) metals to accommodate arbitrary plastic deformation, mechanical twinning occupies an important role in the mechanical behavior of these metals. Twinning causes a significant and abrupt change in the orientation of crystals, whilst simultaneously affecting the hardening and plastic flow behavior of the material considerably. Modeling of forming processes of hexagonal close packed metals thus requires accounting for the evolution of texture and texture induced anisotropy, especially due to twinning. Additionally, the computational framework for the simulation of forming processes must be reliable and efficient in order to guarantee results in realistic time frames. In the present work, a phenomenological constitutive model consisting of an anisotropic yield function, associate flow rule and isotropic hardening, is coupled with the viscoplastic self-consistent polycrystal model in order to capture the slip and twinning activity, texture evolution and the evolving anisotropy during plastic deformation of hcp materials, similar to a hierarchical multi-scale modeling framework proposed by Van Houtte et al. [41] for cubic metals. To account for texture evolution during plastic deformation, the parameters involved in the anisotropic yield function are regularly updated based on mechanical test data obtained from the polycrystal model at the micro-scale. The parameter update is performed at discrete steps instead of every increment. The developed model is applied to describe the behaviors of pure zirconium at liquid nitrogen temperature. The results of the numerical simulations were found to be good agreement with experimental results, and at acceptable computation time.© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we present a simple but versatile approach called FE2AT to use finite element calculations to provide appropriate initial and boundary conditions for atomistic simulations. FE2AT allows us to forgo the simulation of large parts of the elastic loading process, even in the case of complex sample geometries and loading conditions.

The reduction of the anisotropy caused by the basal texture is very important for subsequent forming processes. This project aims at optimizing the hot rolling process with special consideration of texture effects. The development of the model is carried out in close cooperation with the experimental work on magnesium alloy AZ31 .The experimental results are required for the determination of model parameters and for the verification of the model. Deformation-induced texture is described by the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) model of Lebensohn and Tomé. The combination of deformation and recrystallization texture models is applied to hot compression tests on AZ31, and it is found, that the model describes the observed texture and hardening/softening behavior well. In some cases rotation recrystallization occurs in AZ31 which appears to be a possibility to reduce the undesired basal rolling texture.},

One applicable method to increase the strength of DP steels is reducing the grain size. It will be observed through the microstructural modeling that martensite grain size reduction causes some changes in formability which has to be considered in microstructural design of DP steels. © CIMNE.},

   abstract = {In this work, we compare finite element and fast Fourier transform approaches for the prediction of the micromechanical behavior of polycrystals. Both approaches are full-field approaches and use the same visco-plastic single crystal constitutive law. We investigate the texture and the heterogeneity of the inter- and intragranular stress and strain fields obtained from the two models. Additionally, we also look into their computational performance. Two cases—rolling of aluminum and wire drawing of tungsten—are used to evaluate the predictions of the two models. Results from both the models are similar, when large grain distortions do not occur in the polycrystal. The finite element simulations were found to be highly computationally intensive, in comparison with the fast Fourier transform simulations.

   abstract = {Abstract The accumulative roll bonding process is one of the most prominent severe plastic deformation processes for obtaining sheet materials with ultra-fine-grained microstructures and high strength. The properties of such sheets differ significantly from those of conventionally rolled sheets. It is hence desirable to have a simulation framework that can accurately predict the material properties, including the evolving texture and anisotropy during processing. Here, we propose such a framework for multiple pass rolling using explicit finite elements and embedding the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) polycrystal texture model for the material response. To facilitate multiple pass rolling, we propose a novel solution mapping scheme that transfers the material state from the deformed finite element mesh to a new one. Additionally, we implement a two-level parallelization scheme – with decomposition of the FE domain using message passing interface (MPI) and thread based parallelization of the material response using openMP – to ensure reduced simulation times. The predictive capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated by simulating the accumulative roll bonding of aluminum alloy AA5754 sheets. The simulations validate the working of the solution mapping scheme, and clearly show the development of a through thickness gradient of texture and anisotropy in the roll-bonded sheet after two passes.},

The basal texture hampers further processing of the material, leading to high internal stresses and strain localization in the material. Within the framework of the crystal plasticity finite element method, a microstructural constitutive model for twinning has been developed to study the deformation characteristics of magnesium alloy AZ31. The concept of representa- tive volume elements is used to identify internal stresses and strain localization in the material. Texture evolution and grain shape change are additional areas of interest in this work. The simulation results are compared with those from experiments to ascertain the trend of texture evolution.},
